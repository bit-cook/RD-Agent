Each classifier will independently predict the probability for one label, and the final performance will be evaluated using mean column-wise ROC-AUC on a hold-out validation set from the training data. After validation, we will use the entire training set to retrain the classifiers and produce test set predictions. The submission CSV will be saved at `./submission/submission.csv`.->ove the previous solution, I propose stacking a second-level non-linear model (e.g., a LightGBM classifier) on top of the LogisticRegression base model\\'s out-of-fold predictions. The first step is to generate out-of-fold predictions on the training set and predictions on the validation set for each target using the existing TF-IDF+LR pipeline. Then, these predictions (together with the original TF-IDF features, if desired) are used as input to train LightGBM OneVsRest classifiers. This stacking introduces nonlinearity, can leverage differing strengths of the models, and often boosts ROC-AUC in multilabel settings. We\\'ll report the mean column-wise ROC-AUC on the validation set and output the test submission CSV as before.->her improve the existing stacked model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression + LGBM) without major architectural change, I will add character n-gram features to the TF-IDF vectorizer in addition to word n-grams. Character n-grams are particularly effective for toxicity detection, as they can capture variations in offensive language and spelling that word n-grams may miss. Specifically, I will set `analyzer=\"char_wb\"` with n-gram range (3,5) for a second vectorizer, concatenate its features with the word-based TF-IDF, and proceed as before. The code below includes this change, produces validation metrics, and outputs the required submission file.', \"implement a straightforward text classification pipeline using TF-IDF features and a Logistic Regression classifier for each toxicity target (multi-label, six heads).

A simple, atomic improvement is to augment the meta-feature stack: For the LightGBM (level-2) model, in addition to the Logistic Regression OOF predictions, supply a few hand-crafted meta-features derived from the comments themselves—such as length of the comment, number of capital letters, number of exclamation/question marks, and ratio of punctuation. This will provide additional signals for the stacking model, potentially enhancing discrimination and mean ROC-AUC. All other parts (CV, vectorization, stacking) are unchanged for isolation and clarity of effect.\", \"implement a straightforward text classification pipeline using TF-IDF features and a Logistic Regression classifier for each toxicity target (multi-label, six heads).

This gives LightGBM richer information and lets it use high-dimensional text features alongside meta-predictions, increasing its modeling capacity while retaining interpretability. The code below modifies the stacking process accordingly and prints the validation ROC-AUC. The submission file is written to the required location.\"]\n"
